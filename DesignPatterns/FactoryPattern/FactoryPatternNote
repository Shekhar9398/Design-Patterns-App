# Factory Pattern in Swift

## What is a Factory Pattern?
A ** Factory Pattern ** is a design pattern that provides a way to create objects **without specifying their exact class**. It helps encapsulate object creation logic, making the code more flexible and maintainable. It is commonly used in scenarios where multiple related objects need to be instantiated dynamically.

## How It Works
- A factory pattern defines a **protocol or base class** for objects that need to be created.
- It uses a **factory class or factory method** to instantiate and return the appropriate object based on input conditions.
- This pattern **decouples object creation** from the main logic, making it easier to modify and extend.

## Pros of Factory Pattern:
- Encapsulates object creation logic, improving code maintainability.
- Reduces dependencies on concrete classes, promoting loose coupling.
- Makes it easy to introduce new types without modifying existing code.
- Enhances code readability by organizing object creation in one place.

## Cons of Factory Pattern:
- Introduces additional complexity with extra factory classes and methods.
- Can have slight performance overhead due to function calls.
- May be unnecessary for simple object creation scenarios.

## When to Use a Factory Pattern?
- When object creation logic is complex and likely to change.
- When the application needs to support multiple object types dynamically.
- When decoupling object creation from business logic is beneficial.
- When centralizing the instantiation process improves code organization.

## When to Avoid a Factory Pattern?
- When there are only one or two object types, making a factory unnecessary.
- When direct instantiation is simple and does not add significant overhead.
- When excessive abstraction leads to unnecessary complexity in the codebase.
