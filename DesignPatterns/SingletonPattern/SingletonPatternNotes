# Singleton Pattern in Swift

## What is a Singleton?
A **singleton** is a design pattern that ensures a class has only **one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance. It is often used for shared resources like **network managers, database connections, and configuration settings.**

## How It Works
- A singleton class has a **private initializer** to prevent external instantiation.
- It exposes a **static shared instance** that is used throughout the application.

## Pros of Singleton:
- Ensures a single instance of the class across the app.
- Saves memory by preventing multiple object creations.
- Useful for managing shared resources, such as database connections and network requests.
- Improves data consistency by maintaining a single state.

## Cons of Singleton:
- Can introduce hidden dependencies, making testing harder.
- Global state may lead to unexpected side effects.
- Not suitable for instances with different configurations.
- Difficult to extend as it tightly couples components.

## When to Use a Singleton?
- When you need a single point of access to a shared resource.
- When maintaining global state is required.
- When managing heavy objects like database connections efficiently.

## When to Avoid a Singleton?
- When different instances are needed with varying states.
- When working with multithreading, as it can cause race conditions if not implemented properly.
- When writing unit tests, as it increases dependencies and reduces flexibility.
