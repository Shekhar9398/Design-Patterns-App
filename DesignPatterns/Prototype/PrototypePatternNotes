**Prototype Pattern in Swift**

### **Introduction**
The **Prototype Pattern** is a creational design pattern used when object creation is expensive or complex. Instead of creating a new object from scratch, it allows cloning an existing object, which can be more efficient.

### **When to Use the Prototype Pattern?**
- When object creation is expensive or time-consuming.
- When you need to duplicate objects with slight modifications.
- When object initialization involves many configurations.

### **Advantages of the Prototype Pattern**
- Reduces the overhead of object creation.
- Helps in duplicating objects while preserving their structure.
- Provides flexibility in modifying cloned instances.

### **Real-World Use Cases**
- **Game Development:** Cloning characters, enemies, or obstacles.
- **UI Components:** Duplicating buttons, views, or templates.
- **Document Editing Apps:** Copying shapes, text boxes, or graphics.

By using the Prototype Pattern, you can optimize object creation and improve performance in Swift applications.
